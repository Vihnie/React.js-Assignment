 React.js-Assignment
 This project demonstrates how to build modern web interfaces using reusable UI components, external API integration, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Reusable Components: UI elements like buttons, cards, and modals are designed to be flexible and maintainable across the application.

API Integration: Data is fetched from external APIs to dynamically populate the UI, keeping it interactive and up-to-date.

Tailwind CSS: Styling is done using utility-first classes from Tailwind, allowing for rapid development and consistent design without writing custom CSS.
